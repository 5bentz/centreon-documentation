### Monitoring a Cisco Router with SNMP

In this tutorial, we're assuming that your Centreon platform is installed and running well, and that you have at least a [Centreon IT 100 Edition](IT100.html) that provides Centreon Plugin Packs (your [license](../administration/licenses.html) is already set up).

Your Cisco router will be monitored using the [Cisco standard](../integrations/plugin-packs/procedures/network-cisco-standard-snmp.html). (More about Plugin Packs [here](../monitoring/pluginpacks.html)). 

## Prerequisites

### On the cisco router you want to monitor

The first step is to activate and configure an SNMP service on your Cisco device.
Please refer to the documentation of your Cisco device to know how to configure the SNMP service. You have an example on the monitoring procedure of [Cisco standard](../integrations/plugin-packs/procedures/network-cisco-standard-snmp.html).

### Network flow

The target device must be reachable from the Centreon Poller on the UDP/161 SNMP port.

### On the poller

1. Connect to your poller in SSH and install the Cisco standard plugin (see the [monitoring procedure for the **Cisco standard** Plugin Pack](../integrations/plugin-packs/procedures/network-cisco-standard-snmp.html) for more information):

   ```shell
   yum install centreon-plugin-Network-Cisco-Standard-Snmp
   ```

2. In the web interface, go to **Configuration > Plugin Packs**, search and install the **Cisco standard** Plugin Pack:

######################## TODO   ![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_linux_0.gif)

Go to the **Configuration \> Plugin Packs** menu and install **Cisco Standard** Plugin Pack:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_0.gif)

Go to the **Configuration \> Hosts \> Hosts** menu and click on **Add**:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_1.png)

Fill in the following information:

* The name of the server
* A description of the server
* The IP address
* The SNMP version and community

Click on **+ Add a new entry** button in **Templates** field, then select the **Net-Cisco-Standard-SNMP-custom**
template in the list.

Click on **Save**.

Your equipment has been added to the monitoring configuration:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_2.png)

Go to **Configuration \> Services \> Services by host** menu. A set of indicators has been automatically deployed:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_3.png)

Other indicators can be monitored. Click on **Add** button to add a new service as bandwidth usage for example:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_4a.png)

In the **Description** field, enter the name of the service to create, then select the host to link this service. In
the **Template** filed, select the **OS-Linux-Traffic-Generic-Name-SNMP-custom** template.

A list of macros corresponding to the model will then appear:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_4b.png)

Enter the name of the network interface for the **INTERFACENAME** macro value and click on **Save** to add this indicator
into the monitoring configuration.

Do the same to add packet error monitoring:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_5.png)

It is now time to [deploy the supervision](#deploying-a-configuration).

Then go to the **Monitoring \> Status Details \> Services** menu and select **All** value for the **Service Status**
filter. After a few minutes, the first results of the monitoring appear:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_6.png)

#### To go further

The **Cisco Standard** Plugin Pack provides several monitoring templates. When creating a service, it is possible to
search the available models in the selection list: 

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_7.png)

It is also possible to access the **Configuration \> Services \> Templates** menu to know the complete list:

![image](../assets/getting-started/quick_start_cisco_8.png)

> With **Centreon IT Edition** you can add very quickly and very simply the monitoring of your network cards, partition,
> processes and services using the **[Service Discovery](../monitoring/discovery/services-discovery.html)** functionality.

To know manually the name of the available network interfaces you can execute the plugin in command line:

```Shell
/usr/lib/centreon/plugins/centreon_cisco_standard_snmp.pl \
    --plugin=network::cisco::standard::snmp::plugin \
    --hostname=10.40.1.254 --snmp-community=public --snmp-version=2c --mode=list-interfaces
```
You will see the result:
```Shell
List interfaces:
'Gi1/0/1' [speed = 1000, status = up, id = 10101]
'Gi1/0/2' [speed = 1000, status = up, id = 10102]
'Gi1/0/3' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10103]
'Gi1/0/4' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10104]
'Gi1/0/5' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10105]
'Gi1/0/6' [speed = 1000, status = up, id = 10106]
'Gi1/0/7' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10107]
'Gi1/0/8' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10108]
'Gi1/0/9' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10109]
'Gi1/0/10' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10110]
'Gi1/0/11' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10111]
'Gi1/0/12' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10112]
'Gi1/0/13' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10113]
'Gi1/0/14' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10114]
'Gi1/0/15' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10115]
'Gi1/0/16' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10116]
'Gi1/0/17' [speed = 1000, status = up, id = 10117]
'Gi1/0/18' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10118]
'Gi1/0/19' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10119]
'Gi1/0/20' [speed = 100, status = up, id = 10120]
'Gi1/0/21' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10121]
'Gi1/0/22' [speed = 1000, status = up, id = 10122]
'Gi1/0/23' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10123]
'Gi1/0/24' [speed = 1000, status = up, id = 10124]
'Gi1/0/25' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10125]
'Gi1/0/26' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10126]
'Gi1/0/27' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10127]
'Gi1/0/28' [speed = 10, status = down, id = 10128]
```

It is the same to know the name of the spanning-tree:

```Shell
/usr/lib/centreon/plugins/centreon_cisco_standard_snmp.pl \
    --plugin=network::cisco::standard::snmp::plugin \
    --hostname=10.40.1.254 --snmp-community=public --snmp-version=2c --mode=list-spanning-trees
```
You will see the result:
```Shell
List ports with Spanning Tree Protocol:
[port = GigabitEthernet1/0/20] [state = forwarding] [op_status = up] [admin_status = up] [index = 10120]
[port = Port-channel1] [state = forwarding] [op_status = up] [admin_status = up] [index = 5001]
```
