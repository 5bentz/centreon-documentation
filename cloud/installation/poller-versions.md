## How do I know my poller's version?

To know your poller's version, go to **Configuration > Pollers > Pollers**. The version of Engine for your poller is displayed in the **Version** column.

## Which version should my poller have?

* Your poller should be in the latest available version: currently, 24.10.x.
* Version 24.04 is compatible with Centreon Cloud, but it is recommended to [upgrade](../installation/poller-update-upgrade.md) it to 24.10.x.
* All older versions are no longer supported and should be [upgraded](../installation/poller-update-upgrade.md).

## What happens if I do not update?

If you do not update your poller, you may miss important security fixes or improvements. Consider subscribing to [our security bulletins on our commmnity platform The Watch](https://thewatch.centreon.com/latest-security-bulletins-64).

## How often do you publish updates?

We publish updates for pollers regularly, ususally once a month, but we recommend that you check the [Centreon OnPrem Collect release notes](/docs/releases/centreon-os#centreon-collect) every week.

Note that any breaking changes would be announced directly in Centreon Cloud.
